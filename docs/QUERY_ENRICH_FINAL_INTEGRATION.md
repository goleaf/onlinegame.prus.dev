## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### Query Readability Enhancements

**Before (Raw SQL):**

```php
->selectRaw('SUM(CASE WHEN status = "victory" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as victories')
```

**After (Query Enrich):**

```php
->select([
    QE::sum(QE::case()
        ->when(QE::eq(c('status'), 'victory'), 1)
        ->else(0))
        ->as('victories')
])
```

### Complex Aggregations

**Before (Raw SQL):**

```php
->selectRaw('(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM villages WHERE player_id = players.id) as village_count')
```

**After (Query Enrich):**

```php
->select([
    QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
        ->from('villages')
        ->whereColumn('player_id', c('players.id'))
        ->as('village_count')
])
```

### Date Calculations

**Before (Raw SQL):**

```php
->whereRaw('last_activity >= NOW() - INTERVAL ? DAY', [7])
```

**After (Query Enrich):**

```php
->where(c('last_activity'), '>=', QE::subDate(QE::now(), 7, QE::Unit::DAY))
```

## 📊 **Performance Benefits**

// Player with enhanced statistics
$player = Player::withStats()->find($playerId);

// Village with comprehensive data
$village = Village::withStats()->find($villageId);

// Quest with player statistics
$quest = Quest::withPlayerStats($playerId)->find($questId);
```

### Direct Query Enrich Usage

```php
use sbamtr\LaravelQueryEnrich\QE;
use function sbamtr\LaravelQueryEnrich\c;

$results = DB::table('players')
    ->select([
        QE::count(c('villages.id'))->as('village_count'),
        QE::sum(c('villages.population'))->as('total_population')
    ])
    ->leftJoin('villages', 'villages.player_id', '=', 'players.id')
    ->groupBy('players.id')
    ->get();
```
