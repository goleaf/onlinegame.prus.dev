# Translation Checker Integration

This document describes the integration of the Laravel Translation Checker tool into the project.

## Installation

The translation checker has been installed as a development dependency:

```bash
composer require bottelet/translation-checker --dev
```

## Configuration

The configuration file has been published to `config/translator.php` and can be customized as needed.

## Available Commands

### Check Translations

```bash
php artisan translations:check en
```

This command checks for missing translation keys in the specified language and adds them with empty values.

### Find Missing Translations

```bash
php artisan translations:find-missing
```

Finds and adds any missing translations to the source language file.

### Clean Translations

```bash
php artisan translations:clean
```

Removes unused translation keys from the source language file.

### Sort Translations

```bash
php artisan translations:sort
```

Sorts translation files alphabetically.

### Sync Translations

```bash
php artisan translations:sync
```

Synchronizes translations between language files.

## Language Files Structure

The project now includes basic language files for:

- English (`lang/en/messages.php`)
- Spanish (`lang/es/messages.php`)
- French (`lang/fr/messages.php`)

## Usage

1. Use translation keys in your code:

   ```php
   echo __('messages.welcome');
   echo __('messages.hello');
   ```

2. Run the translation checker to find missing keys:

   ```bash
   php artisan translations:check en
   ```

3. Fill in the missing translations in the language files.

4. Use the other commands as needed to maintain translation consistency.
