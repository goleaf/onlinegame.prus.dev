## üéÆ Alliance War System Features

### War Management

```php
// Declare war between alliances
$war = AllianceWar::create([
    'attacker_alliance_id' => $attackerAlliance->id,
    'defender_alliance_id' => $defenderAlliance->id,
    'reason' => 'Territorial dispute',
    'status' => 'active',
    'declared_at' => now(),
    'war_score' => 0,
]);

// Check war status
if ($war->isActive()) {
    // War is ongoing
}

// Get war winner
$winner = $war->winner; // Returns Alliance or null
```

### War Scoring System

```php
// Get war score for specific alliance
$attackerScore = $war->getWarScoreForAlliance($attackerAlliance);
$defenderScore = $war->getWarScoreForAlliance($defenderAlliance);

// Check if alliance is winning
if ($war->isAllianceWinning($attackerAlliance)) {
    // Attacker is winning
}

// Get war progress percentage
$progress = $war->progress_percentage; // 0-100%
```

### Battle Integration

```php
// Get all battles in a war
$battles = $war->battles;

// Add battle to war
$battle = Battle::create([
    'war_id' => $war->id,
    'attacker_village_id' => $attackerVillage->id,
    'defender_village_id' => $defenderVillage->id,
    // ... other battle data
]);
```

## üîß Database Schema

### AllianceWar Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE alliance_wars (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    attacker_alliance_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    defender_alliance_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    status ENUM('active', 'completed', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'active',
    declared_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    war_score INT DEFAULT 0,
    war_data JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (attacker_alliance_id) REFERENCES alliances(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (defender_alliance_id) REFERENCES alliances(id),
    INDEX idx_attacker_alliance (attacker_alliance_id),
    INDEX idx_defender_alliance (defender_alliance_id),
    INDEX idx_status (status),
    INDEX idx_declared_at (declared_at)
