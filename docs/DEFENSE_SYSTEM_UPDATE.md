## 🎮 Defensive Mechanics

### Building Bonuses

```php
// Defensive bonus calculation
private function calculateDefensiveBonus($village)
{
    $totalBonus = 0;

    foreach ($buildings as $building) {
        switch ($buildingType->key) {
            case 'wall':
                $totalBonus += ($level * 0.02); // 2% per level
                break;
            case 'watchtower':
                $totalBonus += ($level * 0.015); // 1.5% per level
                break;
            case 'trap':
                $totalBonus += ($level * 0.01); // 1% per level
                break;
            case 'rally_point':
                $totalBonus += ($level * 0.005); // 0.5% per level
                break;
        }
    }

    return min($totalBonus, 0.5); // Cap at 50%
}
```

### Spy Defense

```php
// Spy defense calculation
private function calculateSpyDefense($village)
{
    $spyDefense = 0;

    $trap = $village->buildings()
        ->whereHas('buildingType', function ($query) {
            $query->where('key', 'trap');
        })
        ->first();

    if ($trap) {
        $spyDefense = $trap->level * 5; // 5% per level
    }

    return min($spyDefense, 100); // Cap at 100%
}
```

### Battle Power Enhancement

```php
// Enhanced battle calculation with defensive bonuses
private function calculateBattleResult($attackingTroops, $defendingTroops, $defenderVillage)
{
    // Calculate base powers
    $attackerPower = 0;
    $defenderPower = 0;

    // Apply defensive bonuses
    $defensiveBonus = $this->calculateDefensiveBonus($defenderVillage);
    $defenderPower *= (1 + $defensiveBonus);

    // Add randomness and determine outcome
    // ... rest of battle logic
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Building types with defensive capabilities
CREATE TABLE building_types (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    key VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    max_level INT DEFAULT 20,
    requirements JSON,
    costs JSON,
    production JSON,
    population JSON,
    is_special BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Buildings table with defensive bonuses
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    village_id BIGINT,
    building_type_id BIGINT,
    level INT DEFAULT 1,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    upgrade_started_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    upgrade_completed_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

### Building Types Added

### Battle Data Enhancement

```php
// Enhanced battle data with defensive information
'battle_data' => [
    'attacking_troops' => $attackingTroops,
    'defending_troops' => $defendingTroops,
    'battle_power' => $battleResult['battle_power'],
    'defensive_bonus' => $battleResult['defensive_bonus'],
]
```
