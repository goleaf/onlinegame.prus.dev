# Query Enrich Extended Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed extended integration of Laravel Query Enrich across additional models and components of the Travian Online Game codebase, further enhancing query readability and performance.

## 🎯 **Extended Integrations Completed**

### 1. **Additional Model Updates**

#### Alliance Model (`app/Models/Game/Alliance.php`)
- ✅ **Enhanced scopeWithStats()** - Replaced complex selectRaw with Query Enrich
- ✅ **Alliance Statistics** - Member counts, points totals, averages, and maximums
- ✅ **Village Aggregations** - Total villages and population across alliance members
- ✅ **Query Enrich Imports** - Added proper imports for QE and c() functions

**Before (Raw SQL):**
```php
->selectRaw('
    alliances.*,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players p WHERE p.alliance_id = alliances.id) as member_count,
    (SELECT SUM(points) FROM players p2 WHERE p2.alliance_id = alliances.id) as total_points,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM villages v WHERE v.player_id IN (SELECT id FROM players p5 WHERE p5.alliance_id = alliances.id)) as total_villages
')
```

**After (Query Enrich):**
```php
->select([
    'alliances.*',
    QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
        ->from('players', 'p')
        ->whereColumn('p.alliance_id', c('alliances.id'))
        ->as('member_count'),
    QE::select(QE::sum(c('points')))
        ->from('players', 'p2')
        ->whereColumn('p2.alliance_id', c('alliances.id'))
        ->as('total_points'),
    QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
        ->from('villages', 'v')
        ->whereIn('v.player_id', function($subQuery) {
            $subQuery->select('id')
                     ->from('players', 'p5')
                     ->whereColumn('p5.alliance_id', c('alliances.id'));
        })
        ->as('total_villages')
])
```

#### Movement Model (`app/Models/Game/Movement.php`)
- ✅ **Enhanced scopeWithStats()** - Comprehensive movement statistics
- ✅ **Village Movement Counts** - Total movements from and to villages
- ✅ **Travel Time Analysis** - Average travel times for different routes
- ✅ **Query Enrich Imports** - Added proper imports

**Before (Raw SQL):**
```php
->selectRaw('
    movements.*,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movements m2 WHERE m2.from_village_id = movements.from_village_id OR m2.to_village_id = movements.from_village_id) as total_movements_from_village,
    (SELECT AVG(travel_time) FROM movements m4 WHERE m4.from_village_id = movements.from_village_id) as avg_travel_time_from
')
```

**After (Query Enrich):**
```php
->select([
    'movements.*',
    QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
        ->from('movements', 'm2')
        ->where(function($q) {
            $q->whereColumn('m2.from_village_id', c('movements.from_village_id'))
              ->orWhereColumn('m2.to_village_id', c('movements.from_village_id'));
        })
        ->as('total_movements_from_village'),
    QE::select(QE::avg(c('travel_time')))
        ->from('movements', 'm4')
        ->whereColumn('m4.from_village_id', c('movements.from_village_id'))

### 4. **Integration Patterns Established**

#### Consistent Query Patterns
All integrations follow established patterns:

1. **Import Structure:**
```php
use sbamtr\LaravelQueryEnrich\QE;
use function sbamtr\LaravelQueryEnrich\c;
```

2. **Subquery with Complex Conditions:**
```php
QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
    ->from('table', 'alias')
    ->where(function($q) {
        $q->whereColumn('alias.column', c('main_table.column'))
          ->orWhereColumn('alias.column2', c('main_table.column2'));
    })
    ->as('result_alias')
```

3. **Nested Subqueries:**
```php
QE::select(QE::count(c('id')))
    ->from('villages', 'v')
    ->whereIn('v.player_id', function($subQuery) {
        $subQuery->select('id')
                 ->from('players', 'p')
                 ->whereColumn('p.alliance_id', c('alliances.id'));
    })
    ->as('total_villages')
```

// Get movements with comprehensive statistics
$movements = Movement::withStats()->where('player_id', $playerId)->get();

// Each movement now includes:
// - total_movements_from_village (count of movements from this village)
// - total_movements_to_village (count of movements to this village)
// - avg_travel_time_from (average travel time from this village)
// - avg_travel_time_to (average travel time to this village)
```

#### Using QueryEnrichAnalyticsService
```php
use App\Services\QueryEnrichAnalyticsService;

// Get comprehensive world analytics
$worldAnalytics = QueryEnrichAnalyticsService::getWorldAnalytics($worldId);

// Get player performance analytics
$playerAnalytics = QueryEnrichAnalyticsService::getPlayerPerformanceAnalytics($playerId, 30);

// Get alliance war statistics
$warStats = QueryEnrichAnalyticsService::getAllianceWarStatistics($allianceId1, $allianceId2);
