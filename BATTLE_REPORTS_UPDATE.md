### Loot Calculation System
```php
private function calculateResourceLoot($defendingVillage)
{
    // Get actual village resources for realistic loot calculation
    $villageResources = $defendingVillage->resources;
    $lootRate = 0.1 + (rand(0, 15) / 100); // 10-25% loot rate
    
    $loot = [];
    foreach ($villageResources as $resource) {
        $availableAmount = $resource->amount;
        $lootAmount = floor($availableAmount * $lootRate);
        $loot[$resource->type] = min($lootAmount, $availableAmount);
    }
    
    return $loot;
}
```

### Casualty Summary Generation
```php
private function generateCasualtiesSummary($losses)
{
    $summary = [];
    $totalLosses = 0;
    
    foreach ($losses as $loss) {
        if ($loss['count'] > 0) {
            $summary[] = "{$loss['unit_type']}: {$loss['count']}";
            $totalLosses += $loss['count'];
        }
    }
    
    return [
        'total' => $totalLosses,
        'breakdown' => $summary,
        'formatted' => $totalLosses > 0 ? implode(', ', $summary) : 'No casualties'
    ];
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Report Creation
```php
private function createBattleReports(Battle $battle)
{
    // Create detailed report for attacker
    Report::create([
        'world_id' => $battle->village->world_id,
        'attacker_id' => $battle->attacker_id,
        'defender_id' => $battle->defender_id,
        'from_village_id' => $battle->battle_data['attacking_troops'][0]['from_village_id'] ?? null,
        'to_village_id' => $battle->village_id,
        'type' => 'attack',
        'status' => $battle->result === 'attacker_wins' ? 'victory' : 'defeat',
        'title' => $this->generateBattleReportTitle($battle, 'attacker'),
        'content' => $this->generateDetailedBattleReportContent($battle, 'attacker'),
        'battle_data' => [
            'battle_id' => $battle->id,
            'result' => $battle->result,
            'attacker_losses' => $battle->attacker_losses,
            'defender_losses' => $battle->defender_losses,
            'resources_looted' => $battle->resources_looted,
            'battle_power' => $battle->battle_data['battle_power'],
            'casualties_summary' => $this->generateCasualtiesSummary($battle->attacker_losses),
            'loot_summary' => $this->generateLootSummary($battle->resources_looted),
        ],
        'is_read' => false,
        'is_important' => $battle->result === 'attacker_wins',
    ]);
}
```

### Resource Transfer System
```php
private function addLootToAttacker($village, $loot)
{
    foreach ($loot as $resourceType => $amount) {
        $resource = $village->resources()->where('type', $resourceType)->first();
        if ($resource && $amount > 0) {
            $resource->increment('amount', $amount);
        }
    }
}
```
